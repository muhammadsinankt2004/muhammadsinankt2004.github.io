<p>The J&K Police and the Indian Army continue to carry out combing operations at the encounter sites in Kulgam’s Chinigam and Motergam areas, where security forces, including the police and the Indian Army, circled two locations and engaged hiding militants in firefights on Saturday. 

    “Once the operation is fully over, we will be able to find out the identities and affiliation of the slain terrorists,” Mr. Swain said.
    
    The DGP said security agencies would be able to take the fight to its “logical conclusion soon, even though the enemy won’t stop from its activities”.</p>
